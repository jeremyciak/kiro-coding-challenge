# Development Guidelines

## Efficiency and Scope

- Prioritize minimum viable implementations that fully satisfy requirements
- Avoid over-engineering or adding features beyond what's explicitly requested
- Focus on completing tasks efficiently with the least amount of code and steps necessary
- Do not add tests, documentation, or additional tooling unless specifically requested

## Code Quality

- Write clean, readable code that solves the problem directly
- Use idiomatic patterns for the language and framework in use
- Ensure code is functional and correct on first implementation

## Decision Making

- Make pragmatic choices that balance speed with maintainability
- When multiple approaches exist, choose the simpler one that meets requirements
- Avoid premature optimization or abstraction
